Long story short we took out lines on several paid up properties that we owned. NO appraisals were ever done. In retrospect WORST MISTAKE OF OUR LIFE!\n",

We worked with XXXX XXXX, Office of the President & it truly sounded as if we could get relief. We jumped through hoops & completed all of the requirements for a loan modification. Worked with XXXX XXXX, Senior Vice President -- all along he said our application was pending. We had 3 equity lines which for sure most likely were fraudulently appraised -- or not appraised at all. We have articles showing that 5/3 made bad loans between XX/XX/XXXXtoXX/XX/XXXX In return 5/3 accepted {$3.00} billion in federal money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\n",
