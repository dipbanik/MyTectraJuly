Works with rewards and penalties.

unsupervised algorithm.

epsilon-greedy strategy - (epsilon = 20%) exploration/exploitation tradeoff

take the best known action most of the time (say, 80% of the time), but occasionally explore a new, randomly selected direction even though it might be walking away from known reward.
over time epsilon reduces.
