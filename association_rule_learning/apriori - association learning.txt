Apriori Algorithm - Support, Confidence, Lift
(similar to naive bayes classifiers)

Movie Recommendations : Support(M) = # user watchlists containing M / # user watchlists

10/100 = 10%

nothing less than 20%

Market Basket Optimisation : Support (I) = # transactions containg I / # transactions

Movie Recommendations : confidence(M1 -> M2) = # user watchlists contains M1 & M2 / # user watchlists containing M1
7/40 = 17.5%

nothing less than 12-15%

Market Basket Optimisation : confidence(l1->l2) = # transactions contaiing l1 & l2 / # transactions containing l2



Movie Recommendations : Lift ( M1 -> M2 ) = confidence (M1 -> M2 ) / support (M2)
17.5/10 = 1.75

rule with the highest lift is the strongest rule

Market Basket Optimisation :  lift (l1 -> l2 )  = confidence(l1 -> l2) / support(l2)

Step 1 : Set a minimum support and confidence

Step 2 : Take all the subsets in transactions having higher support than minimum support

Step 3 : Take all the rules of these subseta having higher confidence than minimum confidence

Step 4 : Sort the rules by decreasing lift
